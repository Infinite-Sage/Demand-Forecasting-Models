# Explainable AI for Demand Forecasting in E-Commerce (Home Decor)

üîç **Executive Summary**  
This project explains what drives next-month home d√©cor purchases using explainable machine learning.  
Using SHAP values and two trained models, we identify which customer behaviors most influence buying decisions ‚Äî helping marketing run smarter campaigns, inventory better plan stock, and strategy create winning bundles.

This project uses **Explainable AI (XAI)** to uncover what drives customers to purchase in the `home_decor` category. By applying **SHAP (Shapley values)** to both a **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model, we identify which features matter most for forecasting next-month demand ‚Äî making predictions **transparent and actionable** for:

- Marketing
- Inventory Planning
- Strategic Decision-Making

---

## Project Objectives

- Identify top predictors of next-month home decor purchases
- Compare feature importance across two model types (RF & KNN)
- Translate model outputs into business-friendly insights
- Support data-driven actions across marketing and inventory teams

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `model.pkl` | Trained RandomForestRegressor |
| `knn_model.pkl` | Trained KNeighborsRegressor |
| `X_train.csv` | Features used to train models |
| `X_test.csv` | Features used for explanation |
| `y_train.csv` | Labels (home decor sales) ‚Äì used for model training |
| `y_test.csv` | Labels for evaluation (not needed for SHAP) |
| `shap_summary_plot.png` | SHAP summary plot |
| `explaining_demand_forecasting.ipynb` | Notebook with SHAP implementation and insights |

## Methodology

- **Explainability Technique:** SHAP ‚Äî a model-agnostic approach based on cooperative game theory
- **Models Used:**
  - `RandomForestRegressor` ‚Äì explained with `TreeExplainer`
  - `KNeighborsRegressor` ‚Äì explained with `KernelExplainer`
- **Model Consistency Check**:  
  - Metric: **Cosine Similarity** of feature importance rankings  
  - Threshold: **‚â• 0.80 = Reliable**  
  - ‚úÖ **Result**: `0.89` ‚Üí The alignment across models indicates **high confidence in interpretability and model stability**.

## Top Predictive Features

| Rank | Feature | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `lag2` | Home decor purchase 2 months ago |
| 2 | `sma_4m` | 4-month moving average of purchases |
| 3 | `lag1` | Home decor purchase 1 month ago |
| 4 | `sma_2m` | 2-month moving average |
| 5 | `sma_2m__colourful_essentials` | Recent spend in related category (cross-sell signal) |

---

üß† **Why Trust the Random Forest More?**

While both models agree on top signals (e.g., `lag1`, `lag2`, `sma_4m`), **Random Forest explanations are more reliable** because:

- TreeExplainer uses model internals for accuracy  
- KNN explanations rely on approximations via Kernel SHAP, which can be noisy or unstable with small sample sizes

‚û°Ô∏è **Use Random Forest‚Äôs SHAP results for making business decisions.**

## üìà Business Summary Table

| Business Area | SHAP Insight | Action |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Marketing     | Recent decor or accessory purchases | Run retargeting ads; trigger email flows |
| Inventory     | Lag-based and moving average demand signals | Pre-stock items with consistent purchase patterns |
| Strategy      | Cross-category interest (e.g., accessories + decor) | Launch bundle promotions; update homepage merchandising |

---

### Business Insights

- **Marketing**: Target users who recently bought decor or similar items
- **Inventory**: Stock planning guided by moving averages and lag trends
- **Strategy**: Cross-sell through category bundles (e.g., Home Decor + Colourful Essentials)

These insights are data-backed and derived from real customer behavior.

## SHAP Summary Plot

This plot shows which features most influence the model‚Äôs output.  
- üî¥ Red = high feature value (e.g., high past spending) ‚Üí pushes prediction **up**  
- üîµ Blue = low feature value ‚Üí pushes prediction **down**

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10
- SHAP
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib (optional SHAP plot)

---

### Future Work

- Try time-series specific models (e.g., XGBoost + lag features)
- Scale SHAP explanations on full dataset
- Add LIME as an alternate explainer for model comparison
- Integrate insights into CRM dashboard for real-time decision-making

---

## Notes
- The y_train.csv and y_test.csv files are only needed if retraining the model. SHAP doesn't require y values directly.
- Data is sampled for speed ‚Äî feel free to scale up using full sets.
- For public sharing, redact or mask any sensitive or proprietary data.
